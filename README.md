It involved stages such as data processing, data cleaning and data visualization.

-	Product Level Performance: Evaluation of how different product lines influence sales.
-	Regional Sales and Order Distribution
## Dataset Overview
VersaBuy’s dataset comprises 17,416 rows of detailed transactional data. It provides a comprehensive view of sales transactions, customer behavior, product performance, and logistics, capturing key business metrics across multiple dimensions. It includes order-level details (e.g., dates, shipping modes, costs), customer demographics (segment, location), product hierarchies (category, sub-category), and regional market segmentation.
## Executive Summary
#### Overview of Findings
- VersaBuy demonstrated a strong growth between 2021 and 2023 with order volume rising by 43.8% and revenue increasing by 48.4%, supported by steady annual average order value of +1.8%/year. 
- The first drop happened in 2024 revenue growth (28.17%) slowed slightly lower than 2023(+34.90%), order volume surging 31.9% as average order value declined by -2.6% indicates that growth relied entirely on volume not customer spend.
- The average order value highlights that while Q4 holiday month consistently drove order volume, high single month transactions occurred outside traditional peak hours.
#### Sales Trend:
- In 2021, November saw the highest order volume (62) and revenue ($79K), likely tied to holiday demand and post-COVID recovery spending. However, the highest average order value occurred in February $1.8k suggesting that while year-end drove volume, purchases were concentrated in non-peak periods.
- In 2022, revenue growth exceeded order volume growth, with December recording revenue ($73k) and the highest order volume (64), and august leading in revenue ($79k) suggests effective promotions or product mix adjustments. Highest average order value in August ($1.6k) points to post-COVID spending dispersion beyond traditional holiday peaks.
- In 2023, Sales peaked in June with 79 orders generating $106K revenue, showcasing strong mid-year performance, while December revenue dropped to $60k despite a record of 71 orders with its average order value of +$1.1k This divergence reveals over-reliance on volume-driven tactics in peak seasons versus value-focused approaches. Meanwhile, February had an average order value of $1.6k reinforcing that non holiday months continued to attract higher targeted campaigns.
-	In 2024, December had 112 orders and $112K revenue, however average order value peak occurred in august($1.5k) again highlighting that the highest volume transaction was concentrated outside traditional peak periods. This recurring pattern suggests that while holiday season drove mass volume, VersaBuy opportunities lie in off peak months possibly tied to seasonal product launches.
